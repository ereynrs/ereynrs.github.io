title: Introduction to Health Care and Life Sciences
---
*Written by [Emiliano Reynares](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ereynrs/)*

Four years ago, I made a big decision. I decided to switch from an academic career to an industrial one. I wanted to apply my skills and knowledge in a more practical and impactful way.

So I moved to a [pharma company](https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/) as a knowledge engineer, although I had almost no experience in the domain. I was responsible for creating and maintaining ontologies and knowledge graphs for different projects.

It was a challenging but rewarding experience. I learned a lot about the pharma, healthcare and life sciences industries, theirs problems and opportunities. I also realized how important it is to have a solid understanding of the domain, especially if you want to apply AI-related techniques to data.

This year, I joined a [leading global provider](https://www.iqvia.com/) of advanced analytics, technology solutions, and clinical research services to the healthcare and life sciences industry, with the role of ontology, knowledge graph and AI expert. I'm excited to work on cutting-edge projects that can make a difference in people's lives.

But I'm not done learning. I'm always looking for new ways to expand my knowledge and skills. And I want to share my learnings with you, since it could be helpful for other professionals facing similar challenges.

That's why I wrote this post on the Healthcare and Life Sciences (HCLS) industry, covering the following topics:

* Medical conditions and care,
* Customers and onther participants,
* Healthcare systems and plans,
* Regulators, and
* Industry Challenges

## The basics
The HCLS industry is [a USD 8 trillion industry](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Finance/gx-rise-global-health-care.pdf) that accounts for [about 10% of the GDP](https://www.oecd.org/health/health-data.htm). It covers a wide range of products, services, and stakeholders. 

Healthcare and life sciences terms are often used interchangeably, but they have some subtle differences. 

__*Healthcare*__ refers to the provision and delivery of medical care to people who need it.

__*Life sciences*__, on the other hand, refer to the scientific study of living organisms and their interactions with the environment.</cite> Life sciences can be applied to healthcare, but they can also have other applications, such as agriculture, biotechnology, or environmental science.

### ... and their impact on the real world
Both of them are essential for improving the quality and quantity of life for humans and other living beings. By understanding how life works, we can find better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat various medical conditions that affect us. [Vaccines](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12929-023-00977-5), [antibiotics](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.647060), and [gene therapies](https://www.nature.com/articles/d43747-023-00093-1) are some of the products of HLS that have saved millions of lives and reduced the burden of diseases. They also help us enhance our physical and mental well-being, by providing us with [tools and strategies](https://www.who.int/health-topics/digital-health) to manage our health and wellness, like [fitness trackers or health apps](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/mhealth-apps-market-102020).

[HCLS addresses some of the global and environmental challenges that we face](https://www.embl.org/news/lab-matters/life-sciences-have-key-role-in-developing-climate-change-solutions/). Biotechnology, biofuels, and bioengineering are some of the applications of life sciences that can help us produce more food, energy, and materials, while reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and minimizing our ecological footprint. HLS also helps us protect and conserve the biodiversity and ecosystems that sustain life on Earth, by providing us with methods and solutions to monitor, restore, and enhance the natural environment, such as bioremediation, biosensors, or bioinformatics.

HCLS offers [plenty of opportunities](https://www.cushmanwakefield.com/en/united-states/insights/life-science-report)  - [and challenges](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/2024-healthcare-services-outlook-challenges-and-opportunities), as the clever reader has surely already guessed -, for businesses, careers, and innovations. HLS is among the fastest-growing and most profitable industries in the world, generating billions of dollars in revenue and creating millions of jobs. It also requires constant research and development, as well as collaboration and regulation, to keep up with the changing needs and expectations of customers and society.

## Medical Conditions and Care

### Medical conditions
A *medical condition* is any situation that impairs the normal function of a person, such as disabilities, injuries, or diseases (also known as disorders, illnesses, or sicknesses). 

* *Disabilities* are impairments that limit one’s ability to perform certain activities.
* *Injuries* are damages caused by external forces, such as accidents, violence, or natural disasters. 
* *Diseases* are conditions that disrupt the normal functioning of the body or the mind. There are:
   * *Infectious diseases* that can be transmitted from one person or organism to another, such as COVID-19, malaria, or tuberculosis.
   * *Chronic diseases* lasting for a long time or recur frequently, such as diabetes, cancer, or heart disease.
   * *Mental disorders* affecting the mood, thinking, or behavior of a person, such as depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia. 

*Note:* The reproductive health of a person, such as pregnancy and childbirth, is considered part of medical care, but it's not a medical condition. 

### Medical care
*Medical care* is the process of preventing, diagnosing, and treating medical conditions. 

*Prevention* is about avoiding or reducing the risk of developing or worsening a medical condition. It involves adopting healthy behaviors - such as eating well, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking or drinking-, and applying preventive measures like immunization, screening, or prophylaxis to protect against or detect potential medical conditions before they become serious or symptomatic.

*Diagnosis* is about identifying and determining the nature and cause of a medical condition. It can be done though physical examination, medical history, laboratory tests, or imaging techniques, that provide information about the signs and symptoms, the underlying mechanisms, and the possible complications of a medical condition.

*Treatment* is about managing or curing a medical condition. It encompasses medication, surgery, therapy, or lifestyle changes, that can alleviate or eliminate the signs and symptoms, the underlying mechanisms, and the possible complications of a medical condition.

## Customers and other industry participants
The key stakeholders of the HCLS) industry are the __*customers*__, *aka the people or entities that benefit from the products or services that the industry offers*. They can be __*patients*__ or other __*industry participants*__.

### Patients
Patients are people who receive medical care. They can be individuals or groups, such as families, communities, or populations. 

They’re are typically classified into three categories, depending on their relationship with the healthcare system (hold on this, and wait for the next post).

The *consumers* are the patients who pay for their own medical care, either out of pocket or through private insurance. These are patients who pay for their own medical care, either out of pocket or through insurance. They have the right to choose their providers, treatments, and outcomes. They also have the responsibility to follow their prescriptions, appointments, and instructions.

The *members* are the patients who belong to a health plan or a health system, such as [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/basics/get-started-with-medicare) or [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/about-us/beneficiary-resources/index.html#eligibility). They have the benefit of accessing a network of providers, treatments, and resources.

The *beneficiaries* are patients who receive medical care as a benefit from a third party, such as a government agency or a charity. They receive medical care from a government agency or a charity, such as the [Global Fund](https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/), the [Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/), or [Médecins Sans Frontières](https://www.msf.org/). They get free or subsidized medical care, regardless of their ability to pay.

### Other industry participants
The other industry participants are the people or entities that either approve medical care for patients or support other industry participants. They can be public or private, local or global, for-profit or non-profit.

The *healthcare providers* are individuals or facilities that directly provide medical care to patients - such as physicians, dentists, hospitals, clinics, or outpatient centers-, and charge fees for their services and products.

The *healthcare payers* are entities that pay (reimburse) for the medical care given to patients by providers such as governments, health insurance companies, or not-for-profit organizations.

The *biopharma companies* are the pharmaceutical or biotech companies providing services and products for medical care, such as drugs, diagnostic tests, or biotechnology.

The *medical technology companies* provide services and products to support healthcare providers. They can be medical technology manufacturers building, for instance, diagnostic imaging equipment, implants, or prosthetics; or healthcare IT companies like [IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com/).

The *governments* regulate, fund, or oversee the HLS industry, such as the [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/) or the [European Medicines Agency (EMA)](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/homepage). They set standards and guidelines for the approval and use of medical care, establish the prices of products and services, and fund key research. They can also play a role as healthcare provider, healthcare payer, or industry regulator, depending on the level and scope of their involvement. They can be national, regional, or local governments, such as the [US Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/) or the [Catalan Health Service](https://web.gencat.cat/en/inici/).

The *not-for-profit organizations* advocate, educate, or support the HLS industry, such as the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/). They address the needs and challenges of underserved populations and regions, advance medical research and expand medical care, such as the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/) or the [Médecins Sans Frontières](https://www.msf.org/). 

The *consumer technology companies* provide products or services that enhance or complement healthcare like fitness trackers, telemedicine platforms, or health apps. They are attracted by the long-term growth potential of the industry and leverage their expertise in areas such as AI, data, devices, or e-commerce. The usual suspects are here: Alphabet, Apple, or Amazon. 

## Health Care Systems and Health Care Plans

Relationship between patients, payers, and providers. This unique characteristic is driven by two issues: 1) universal coverage of health - I.e. in some counties or regions healthcare is considered a universal right-, and 2) inconsistent cost of medical care, i.e.: people may spend nothing in healthcare  during long periods of time but need of an expensive treatment out of the blue. To tackle that, some people pays regular small amount of money (premiums) to payers to be covered when the unexpected happens-.

_**Healthcare plan:**_ It defines 1) who is eligible or required to participate in a plan, 2) the healthcare services and providers that are covered, and 3) the funding of the plan. They’re provided by healthcare payers, and they’re just a part of a healthcare system.

_**Healthcare systems:**_ they comprise multiple healthcare plans, by encompassing the entire infrastructure  to provide healthcare: providers, payers, regulators, and other government agencies. Types: Socialized healthcare systems, National health insurance systems, Employer-sponsored insurance systems, and Individual responsibility healthcare systems.

_**Socialized healthcare systems:**_ It’s been created under the principle that the national government has to provide equal access to healthcare to all individuals. Then the government owns, operates, and manages the payments for the entire system to provides universal coverage. It implies that most of the facilities (hospital, clinics, etc) are owned by the government, the professionals are either government employees or closely regulated by it, the basic healthcare is free of charge, and financing is based on general taxes on the population. An example is the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. US provides this kind of system for military personnel. Other healthcare systems can - and often do -  also co-exist with this one.

_**National health insurance systems:**_ The government controls one or more health insurance plans that reimburse private healthcare providers. The insurance plans are funded by taxes and/or premiums. These plans are usually the primary or only third-party payer (single payer system), which allows the government to control the services that are covered and their price. France and Canada are typical examples of countries having this kind of system. Although the system provides universal coverage, other health care system often co-exist with it.  US offer this coverage under certain conditions (see Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)).

_**Employer-sponsored health insurance:**_ Plans are provided through the employers, and premiums are paid by employers and/or employees. It’s the primary form of healthcare coverage in the US (known as group health insurance). Alternative healthcare systems usually exist to cover un-employed individuals.

_**Individual responsibility healthcare systems:**_ People pays directly for healthcare.

## Regulators
HCLS is a highly regulated industry.

The type of health case system determines the scope and role of regulators, which makes them vary a lot from country to country.

Most countries have national government health-related ministers or departments. Examples: The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), or the National Health Commission in China.  The UD FDA is the agency within the HHS which regulation authority over drugs, biological products, and medical devices - is part of the HHS.
US FDA and EMA - the European FDA counterpart - serve as de facto global regulators.
Some countries require international approval of products plus local additional evaluation to make them available to the public.
Some countries - like US and Canada - also partially delegates the regulation authority to local administrations.

National HLS regulation authorities typically are responsible for:

* Setting national healthcare priorities.
* Allocating funds and setting budgets for healthcare plans (when required by the type of healthcare system adopted by the country.
* Accrediting healthcare facilities,
* Licensing healthcare professionals
* Establishing standard level of patient care and safety
* Approving reimbursement rates paid to providers
* Reviewing the safety of new medical products
* Protecting the privacy and confidentiality of patients

## Industry Challenges
* Covid-19 (2019 - 2023)
* Rising health care costs (the greatest and log-term challenge the industry faces today)
    * Health care costs rise faster than economic growth in many countries. 4 factors influencing this:
        * Aging populations. Older population requires further services related to cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and CNS related disorders.
        * Escalating chronic diseases, provoked by unhealthy habits and environmental pollution (e.g.: obesity, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and respiratory diseases.)
        * Advances in medical technology and drugs. Technological improvements enable better care but the initial cost of new developments is higher.
        * Structural inefficiencies on the health care systems or payment models, and the recurring performing of unneeded procedures. Bureaucracy introduced by governments is at the core of this issue.
* Cybersecurity
    * Cybersecurity risks associated with networked medical devices.
    * Attacks to health care providers and payers.
    * Cybersecurity in health care is weak because of high fragmentation and low sophistication of participants and systems.
    * HCLS participants must fulfill consumer privacy regulation as GDPR and HIPAA.
* Advances in science and technology
    * Medical technology, like diagnostic imaging equipment, robotic surgery, and implants to monitor patients or release drugs.
    * Genetic testing to identify patient risks of developing a condition and/or customize treatment.
    * Gene therapy, applied to correct or replace defective genes identified in genetic testing.
    * Immunotherapy, which involves CAR-T therapy in which cells are re-engineered to target specific cancers.
    * Personalized medicine to administer individualized medical treatment (e.g.: gene therapy, implantable devices) based on patient characteristics like age, gender, and genome.
* Digital disruption, which makes appear new players in the market like Amazon or Google, and creates new expectations on the patients. HCLS invest in IT to 1) improve efficiency, 2) reduce medical errors, 3) enhance patient outcomes, and 4) support regulatory compliance. IT for HCLS is known as HCIT. E.g:
    * New analytics
    * AI
    * IoT
    * 5G
    * Augmented and virtual reality (AR)
    * Blockchain
    * Robotic Process a¡Automation (RPA)

### How the industry tries to keep health care costs under control?
1. Focusing on prevention, since preventing is more effective than treating a condition. Ad campaigns, educational resources, and reward programs promoting healthier life styles.
2. Shifting to evidence-based medicine, which provides medical treatment based on standardized industry best practices; as opposed to opinion-based medicine. Opinion-based medicine provides medical treatment based on the physician experience, opinion and knowledge. This generates inconsistency in patient outcomes and misuse of tests and treatments. Mostly payers are investing in research, data, and analytics to understand clinical/cost effectiveness and safety of treatments.
3. Improving collaboration between providers and payers to reduce redundancies.
