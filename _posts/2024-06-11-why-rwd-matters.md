title: Why Healthcare Real-World Data matters?
---
*Written by [Emiliano Reynares](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ereynrs/)*

Real-World Data (RWD) is a transformative force reshaping the healthcare landscape. 

RWD provides a panoramic view of people’s health by tapping into data collected from everyday clinical practice, wearables, social determinants, and environmental factors. Unlike traditional clinical trials, RWD captures the real-world complexities that patients face.

RWD matters because it can:

* make Drug Discovery more efficient. Imagine accelerating drug development by leveraging insights from millions of real patients.

* support expansion of On-Label Indications. RWD can helps us uncover new uses for existing treatments.

* make Healthcare Systems more sustainable. By optimizing treatments based on real-world evidence, we can create more sustainable healthcare systems.

* supports Regulatory Approvals and Market Access for novel therapies. It’s the bridge between innovation and patient impact.

But RWD diversity in volume, dynamism, and quality comes with its own set of hurdles:

1. Discoverability.
We need robust metadata to navigate the vast RWD ocean effectively. 

2. Integration.
We need to harmonize data formats, standards, and terminologies. It’s complex but crucial.

OHDSI’s OMOP CDM is battling integration woes head-on.
HMA/EMA’s Framework is paving the way for RWD integration into regulatory decision-making.

But it's not enough. To fully reap RWD’s benefits, we need:

* RWD-Specific Metadata Vocabulary, a language to describe RWD —syntax and semantics included.

* Metadata Model, defining relationships and constraints. It have to enable alignment with other metadata standards.

* Machine-Actionable, to process it in a standardized fashion.
