title: Why This Blog?

*Written by [Emiliano Reynares](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ereynrs/)*

Reading has always been essential to me, and writing has gradually become its ideal partner. However, I was frustrated trying different social media platforms, as the content fragmentation and platform lock-ins did not satisfy me. After trying a few, I abandoned them and started anew. It’s unsustainable and demotivating.

I want to create a dedicated space to develop my writing skills and document my thoughts and ideas. I read articles, books, and long posts, and by writing about them, I can reinforce my learning and create a library of notes and ideas to revisit.

I also want a single landing site for my spontaneous note-taking. While working on a project or browsing the web, I often want to capture tidbits of valuable information to remember later. Having a unique stock of notes will make it easier for me to refer back to them later and organize them into more cohesive thoughts and ideas.

Ultimately, this blog will remind me of the learning path that brought me here. It will contain traces of my experiences to help me understand how I got to this point and reflect on the past to guide my future decisions.

Are they three good enough reasons to kick off this blog? I believe so. And having that said, vamos allá!
