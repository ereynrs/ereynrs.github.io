[AirBnB’s approach](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/data-quality-score-the-next-chapter-of-data-quality-at-airbnb-851dccda19c3) to scaling data quality is an insightful advancement.

Transitioning from a binary quality indicator to a spectrum across multiple criteria increases data engagement. It recognizes data quality’s complexity and meaningfully empowers both producers and consumers.

Incentivation over enforcement promotes continuous improvement and collaboration, enhances transparency and guide data teams towards quality enhancements.

The three-tiered data quality score system adeptly serves various use cases.
A 0-100 single score for a swift, comprehensive dataset quality assessment.
Dimensional scores to provide targeted insights for consumers with particular needs.
Detailed dimensional scores to offer a roadmap for data teams to prioritize improvements.

The recently published European Medicines Agency’s [data quality framework](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/regulatory-procedural-guideline/data-quality-framework-eu-medicines-regulation_en.pdf) for data-driven regulatory decision-making parallels this approach. It outlines data quality considerations, defines quality dimensions, describes metrics, and analyzes actions and metrics for diverse use cases.

Observing the evolution and convergence of data quality proposals into a similar approach, regardless of industry origin, is indeed compelling.
