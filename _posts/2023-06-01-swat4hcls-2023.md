---
*Written by [Emiliano Reynares](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ereynrs/)* 

_Semantic Web Applications and Tools for Healthcare and Life Sciences_ ([SWAT4HCLS](https://www.swat4ls.org/)) is a venue for presenting and discussing novel ideas, experiences, and issues in the application of semantic and web technologies in the biomedical domain at large.

Starting in 2008, SWAT4HCLS has been held continuously for more than 10 years, expanding from a one-day workshop to a four-day event composed of tutorials, conferences, and hackathons.

SWAT4HCLS intends to provide an open and vibrant discussion space cross-cutting across academia, industry, and institutional participants.

## Keynotes

__*Scaling up semantics. Lessons learned.*__

It claims a strategy for scaling up semantics, by working with and appealing to the producers and consumers of data, developing technologies that add semantics and integrative value using existing tools, rather than forcing change. Resources worth looking at:
* [Python @dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)
* [pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/)
* [ODK](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit) / [OAK](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-access-kit) ([docs](https://incatools.github.io/ontology-access-kit/))
* [LinkML](https://linkml.io/) ([GitHub org](https://github.com/linkml))
* BioLink ([GitHub org](https://github.com/biolink), [Biolink Model paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36125173/), [BioLink Model docs](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/))
* [OntoGPT](https://monarch-initiative.github.io/ontogpt/) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/ontogpt)).

__*Combining knowledge graphs with machine learning, with examples from healthcare and life sciences.*__

The goal is to understand and categorize hybrid learning and reasoning systems through a tool/framework to design hybrid learning and reasoning systems. The framework is based on design patterns (See [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11965) and [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12389) paper). 

Examples: 
* [Predictive modeling of colorectal cancer using a dedicated pre-processing pipeline on routine electronic medical records.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vr__xRsMpHM1dJF4ONSKsOPY11-QFNZi)
* Generating Knowledge Graph-Based Explanations for Drug Repurposing Predictions. (SWAT4HCLS paper)
* [Expert RuleFit: Complementing Rule Ensembles with Expert Knowledge.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maltenlz/Malte-Nalenz/main/ERF.pdf)
* Attention for Multi-Ontology Concept Recognition .(SWAT4HCLS paper)
* [Predicting Polypharmacy Side-effects Using Knowledge Graph Embeddings.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32477666)
