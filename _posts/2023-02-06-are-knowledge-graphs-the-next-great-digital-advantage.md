*Written by [Emiliano Reynares](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ereynrs/)*

The future of business success is here, and it’s all about knowledge graphs. That’s the bold claim made by the authors of a recent Harvard Business Review [article](https://hbr.org/2022/05/the-next-great-digital-advantage), and after reading it, I couldn’t agree more. The world’s leading technology companies — think Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Netflix — are already using knowledge graphs to gain a competitive edge and increase their revenue.

So, what exactly are knowledge graphs and why are they so powerful? Simply put, they allow us to organize and analyze vast amounts of data in a way that traditional databases just can’t. By using proprietary algorithms to sift through the data and identify patterns, companies can provide customized value and insights to their customers.

If you’re feeling a bit left behind, don’t worry. The authors offer four action points to help you catch up with the leaders:

* Develop a knowledge graphs strategy and roadmap.
* Create proprietary algorithms to conduct various types of data analysis.
* Update your technology infrastructure and talent recruitment strategy.
* Adopt a value-driven approach by using knowledge graphs to solve specific problems for customers.

The knowledge graphs enable the reshaping of the competition in every industry, and it’s time for every company to recognize their potential. By taking a structured approach to organizing data, leaders can develop innovative solutions to customer problems, giving them a digital and business advantage.
