title: Big Techs shouldn’t drive application of GenAI to healthcare

*Written by [Emiliano Reynares](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ereynrs/)*

The use of LLMs in medicine poses such formidable challenges around safety, privacy and equity that those at the front line of care should drive the development and deployment of the models.

It is hard to see how LLMs that are developed and controlled behind closed corporate doors could be broadly adopted in health care without undermining the accountability and transparency of both medical research and medical care.

Whereas transparent efforts could provide a solid foundation for AI in medicine, building medicine on the top of proprietary, secretive models is akin to building on a house of cards.
