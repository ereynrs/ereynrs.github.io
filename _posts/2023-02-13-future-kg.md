*Written by [Emiliano Reynares](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ereynrs/)*

The adoption of knowledge graphs has been steadily rising across several information-intensive industry sectors including those in life sciences, financial services, health care, and manufacturing.

This sign of maturity is one of the conclusions from the 2nd Annual Knowledge Graph Benchmarking Study.

But growth and progress are not the only plots of the story […]. See the report [here](https://www.knowledgegraph.tech/knowledge-graph-industry-survey-2022/).

Actually, the study has shown the crucial role that organization plays in the success of these initiatives. In the end, it’s all about:

🤝 getting different stakeholders on board to work together and embrace new approaches to data management.

📜 overcoming bureaucracy, which slows down the progress of the knowledge grasp due to the challenges of aligning strategy across operational boundaries.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 small but mighty team of specialists, including experienced architects, ontologists, knowledge engineers, and project managers.

It’s also evident the split between organizations still experimenting with knowledge graphs and those fully committed to adopting them for mission-critical applications.
