title: Build your Domain Ontology out of your Business Glossary

*Written by [Emiliano Reynares](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ereynrs/)*

Your business glossary is the bedrock of your domain language, defining key terms that keep your business ticking. But what if you could take it a step further?

Consider this: “A Customer is an individual or organization that purchases goods or services from a company.” Seems simple, but there’s more than meets the eye.

In this single sentence, we unearth:

* Other terms: individual, organization, good, service, company.
* Term hierarchies: goods and services are types of assets that can be purchased.
* Term’s roles: Is an individual a type of customer, or is it the role they play when purchasing an asset?
* Relationships among terms: a customer purchases things from a company.

By building an ontology, you’re not just defining terms - you’re mapping out their intricate relationships and roles. 

The benefits?

* Improved Data Governance: Ensure consistent use of terms AND their relationships across your organization.
* Enhanced Data Integration: Use your ontology as a framework to align data from disparate sources to business concepts.

P.S: What’s the secret ingredient for your ontology development journey?
